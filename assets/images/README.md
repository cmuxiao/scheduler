# Images Directory

This directory contains images used throughout the application.

## Favicon

A favicon.ico file should be added to this directory. You can create one using online tools like:

1. [Favicon.io](https://favicon.io/) - Easy to use favicon generator
2. [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) - More advanced favicon generator

### Recommended Favicon Properties:

- Size: 32x32 pixels minimum (create multiple sizes if possible)
- Format: .ico file (though PNG is also supported by most browsers)
- Design: Simple and recognizable at small sizes
- Color: Use a color that matches your brand/theme

Once created, place the favicon.ico file in this directory. The HTML files already reference it as:

```html
<link rel="icon" href="assets/images/favicon.ico" type="image/x-icon">
```
